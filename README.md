# Mission to Io: Aerospace Robotics Unipi

## Overview

This project involves the use of two main files, "solar_system.m" and "generate_trj.m," to model the solar system and generate orbital trajectories for a mission to Io. The mission is focused on aerospace robotics, utilizing the capabilities of the Unipi platform.

## Files

1. solar_system.m
This file is responsible for creating a solar system model and defining orbits to extract the position and velocity of the planets. It serves as the foundation for generating accurate trajectories for the mission.

2. generate_trj.m
This file is used to generate orbital trajectories within the solar system and inside the Sphere of Influence (SOI) of specific celestial bodies. It plays a crucial role in planning the mission route and ensuring the spacecraft follows a predefined path.

## Instructions

Running the Simulation:
Execute the solar_system.m file to create the solar system model.
Run the generate_trj.m file to generate orbital trajectories for the mission.
Parameters and Configuration:
Ensure to review and modify any relevant parameters within the files to customize the mission according to specific requirements.
Check for comments within the code to understand the purpose and functionality of each section.
Output:
The output of the simulation may include position and velocity vectors, trajectory plots, or any other relevant information depending on the implementation.
Dependencies

Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed, such as MATLAB or Octave, to run the simulation successfully. Additionally, any specific libraries or toolboxes required for aerospace modeling should be installed and configured.

## Additional Notes

This project assumes a basic understanding of celestial mechanics and aerospace engineering principles.
Make sure to refer to the documentation of the Unipi platform for any specific guidelines or recommendations regarding robotics and control systems.
